Uniform circular motion describes an object moving at constant speed along a circular path of radius \\( r \\). The direction of the velocity continuously changes, producing a radial (centripetal) acceleration toward the center, and the tangential acceleration is zero.

$$ a_c = \frac{v^2}{r} = \omega^2 r $$

Where

* \\( \small a_c \\) is the centripetal (radial) acceleration,
* \\( \small v \\) is the tangential speed,
* \\( \small r \\) is the radius of the circular path,
* \\( \small \omega \\) is the angular frequency,
* \\( \small m \\) is the mass,
* \\( \small \theta \\) is the angular position,
* \\( \small T \\) is the period (time for one revolution),
* \\( \small f \\) is the frequency, and
* \\( \small s \\) is the arc length along the path.

## Related relationships

- Tangential (linear) speed:

  $$ v = \omega r $$

- Angular position as a function of time (constant \\( \omega \\)):

  $$ \theta(t) = \theta_0 + \omega t $$

- Period and frequency:

  $$ T = \frac{2\pi}{\omega}, \quad f = \frac{1}{T}, \quad \omega = 2\pi f $$

- Arc length and angle:

  $$ s = r\theta $$

-- Centripetal force (net radial force required for the circular path):

  $$ F_c = ma_c = m\frac{v^2}{r} = m\\omega^2 r $$
